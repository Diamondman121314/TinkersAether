# Tinker's Aether

Tinker's Aether is an addon for Tinker's Construct which adds support for materials from Aether Legacy.

## Materials
Current materials include:
<ul>
<li>Skyroot</li>
<li>Holystone</li>
<li>Zanite</li>
<li>Gravitite</li>
</ul>
Each of these has traits somewhat equivalent to the abilities already existent in their respective tools in Aether Legacy.

## Dart Shooter
Currently the mod only adds one new tool, the Dart Shooter. The Dart Shooter acts much like its counterpart from Aether Legacy, and can shoot all of its darts.

## Darts
In addition, you can make custom darts much the same you would make other ammunition items in Tinker's Construct, and these can also be fired from Tinker's Dart Shooters.

## Future Additions
In the future, I would like to add Valkyrie tools, but am waiting until I can add a custom 'Valkyrie Ingot' to Silver Dungeon loot. Currently, Aether Legacy does not allow adding new loot to its dungeons.
