# Tinker's Aether

Tinker's Aether is an addon for Tinker's Construct which adds support for materials from Aether Legacy.

## Materials
Current materials include:
<ul>
  <li>Skyroot</li>
  <li>Holystone</li>
  <li>Zanite</li>
  <li>Gravitite</li>
  <li>Golden Amber (as of 1.0.3)</li>
  <li>Valkyrie Metal (as of 1.1.0)</li>
  <li>Swet (as of 1.1.0)</li>
  <li>Candy Cane (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Cold Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Blue Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Golden Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
</ul>
Each of these that have corresponding tools in Aether Legacy have traits somewhat equivalent to the abilities already existent in those.

Materials can be individually disabled in the config as of Version 1.0.2.

## Dart Shooter
Currently the mod only adds one new tool, the Dart Shooter. The Dart Shooter acts much like its counterpart from Aether Legacy, and can shoot all of its darts.

#### Darts
In addition, you can make custom darts much the same you would make other ammunition items in Tinker's Construct, and these can also be fired from Tinker's Dart Shooters.

Both Darts and Dart shooters can be disabled entirely in the config as of Version 1.0.2.

## Future Additions
I would like to add Valkyrie Metal to Silver Dungeon loot, but cannot currently as Aether Legacy does not support adding or editing dungeon loot.<br>
I would like to add support for Construct's Armory as well, with the ability to make Gloves.
